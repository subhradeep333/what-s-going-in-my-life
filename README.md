# 🌱 What’s Going On In My Life

This repository is a **living documentation of my life** —  
my thoughts, goals, struggles, growth, and everything in between.

Not everything here is perfect.  
Not everything is finished.  
But everything here is real.

## 🧠 Why This Repository Exists

Life doesn’t come with version control —  
so I built one.

This repo helps me:
- Track personal growth
- Reflect on decisions & emotions
- Document lessons learned
- Capture ideas before they fade
- Stay honest with myself
